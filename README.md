# Universal-Robot-UR5-Controller
This package is developed to enable the control of a UR5 Robot.
# Getting Started
Here, Gazebo is used for simulation of UR5 robot. Which is available at https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot.git
# Prerequisites
ROS installed Machine + Gazebo Simulator
# Test Environment
Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (Xenial) + ROS Kinetic

# Installation & Setup
1. Install and build  ros-industrial/universal_robot from, https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot.git ( make sure your package is installed in /opt/ros/kinetic and not locally.)
2. Creat a new workspace in your local directory. eg.(universalbot_ws)
3. Simply clone this repository in your new worksapce with, https://github.com/amjack0/Universal-Robot-UR5-Controller.git and build the package with catkin_make. look out for errors !
4. Now, locate ros-industrial/universal_robot repo from opt/ros/kinetic. open files as a super user with command , eg. ``` sudo gedit ur.gazebo.xacro ```
5. open\
   common.gazebo.xacro\
   ur.gazebo.xacro\
   ur5_robot.urdf.xacro\
   Edit these files as per the files present in this repo at ```force_pub/src/config```
   After prforming changes you can remove above xacro files from your local workspace.
6. After building the package,compile it & don't forget to source the workspace, eg.```source/universalbot_ws/devel/setup.bash```

# Running the simulation
1. ```roslaunch ur_gazebo ur5.launch``` , this will bring your ur5 robot model on gazebo.
2. ```roslaunch force_pub urm_robot_controller.launch``` , this will launch your controller.
3. ```rosrun force_pub force1_node 50 20``` , by running this command we are starting our force publisher which publishes force in X,Y and Z by passing frequency and amplitude as an argument respectively.
4. ```rosrun force_pub tcp_node``` , this node will publishe the messages on wrist_2_joint & wrist_3_joint (End effector of UR5)

By running these command will enable our endeffector_frc_trq_controller to control the joints, in this repo we are only controlling wrist_3_joint & wrist_2_joint with effort_controllers/JointEffortController. 

Discussion: Results can be improved by further tuning the PID values for joints. This was not attempted due to the time contraint.
